At the start of a Monopoly game, several key events and setups occur to initialize the game. Here's a breakdown of what typically happens:

1. Setup the Board and Components
   Place Properties and Cards: The game board is arranged with properties, Chance cards, and Community Chest cards in their respective positions.
   Allocate Tokens: Each player selects a token (e.g., car, hat, dog) to represent them on the board.
2. Distribute Starting Money
   Each player receives a predefined amount of starting money, typically:
   2 x $500
   4 x $100
   1 x $50
   1 x $20
   2 x $10
   1 x $5
   5 x $1
   The bank is set up to manage the rest of the money, properties, and houses/hotels.
3. Decide the Turn Order
   All players roll the dice to determine the turn order. The player with the highest roll goes first.
4. Place Players on the Starting Position
   All players place their tokens on the "GO" square.
5. Game Rules and Starting Events
   Game Rules: The banker or a designated player explains the rules to ensure everyone is on the same page.
   Initial Turns: On each player's turn:
   Roll two six-sided dice.
   Move the number of spaces indicated on the dice.
   Take actions based on the space landed on (e.g., buying properties, paying rent, drawing a Chance card).
6. Bank Responsibilities
   The bank handles transactions such as:
   Collecting fines and taxes.
   Selling properties.
   Managing houses, hotels, and mortgages.
   Paying players $200 every time they pass "GO."
7. First Moves
   Players start taking their turns, rolling dice, and progressing through the board. They can:
   Buy unowned properties.
   Pay rent if landing on an owned property.
   Draw a Chance or Community Chest card if landing on those spaces.
   Go to jail if landing on the "Go to Jail" space or drawing a card instructing them to do so.
   Considerations for a Digital Monopoly Game:
   For a Monopoly game you're building, you'll need to:

Initialize player accounts with starting money.
Generate the board dynamically and assign ownership of properties to the game bank initially.
Determine turn order programmatically.
Handle transactions such as buying properties, paying rent, or drawing cards through smart contracts.
Track player positions and ensure appropriate actions are triggered based on the square they land on.
